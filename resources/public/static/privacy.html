<h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2>

<h3>We collect the following types of information about you</h3>
<br/>
<b>Information you provide us directly</b>
<br/>
<p>
We allow, but do not require, you to provide biographical information sufficient for the creation of an artist CV, defined in the
artist profile. This information includes email, phone and year of birth; it is not shared with any third party.
The images and description of artwork are not shared with any third party unless consent is provided by you, such as when
you post an artwork to social media from Helodali.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Information we may receive from third parties</b>
<br/>
<p>
Helodali uses third party identity providers to allow you to login with credentials maintained elsewhere (e.g. Facebook, Google, etc.). We ask these
identity providers to provide us with your email and name. This information is only used by Helodali to communicate with you and is not shared
with a third party. If using the Helodali feature which integrates with Facebook and Instagram to pull images of artwork, we ask for your
consent and limit the data gathering to just images and associated "like" counts. Helodali does not look for or use lists of friends or followers.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Analytics and Cookies</b>
<br/>
<p>
At this time, Helodali does not collect usage data using third party tools such as Google Analytics. Helodali makes minimal use of HTTP Cookies.
A session key is placed in the cookie which contains no personal information.
</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p>

such as your web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact
with links on the service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. Helodali does not use methods which
allow sensitive data to be written in access logs, such as URL based parameter passing of identity information.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Tracking and Location</b>
<br/>
<p>
Helodali does not employ any tracking mechanism nor does it collect location data from web or mobile clients.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Commercial and marketing communications</b>
<br/>
<p>
We use your email address to communicate directly with you. We may send you service-related emails
(e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the service,
technical and security notices).
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Sharing of Your Information</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Helodali does not in any case rent or sell personally identifiable information.
</p>
<br/>
<b>Instances where we are required to share your information</b>

 believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement;
  (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our service; and/or
  (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Helodali, our Users, or others.
